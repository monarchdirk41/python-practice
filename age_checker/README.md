## 🧪 How It Works

1. User is asked to **log in** with their name and age
2. If the credentials match an entry in the system:
   - Access is granted to the main menu
3. The user can then:
   - Add new users with age validation
   - View the current list of users
   - Exit the program
4. If login fails more than 3 times, access is denied
