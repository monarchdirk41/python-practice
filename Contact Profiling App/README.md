# üìá Python Contact Profiling App

A terminal-based Python application that allows you to manage a list of contacts. This project is designed to help you practice and master the use of Python dictionaries, nested data structures, functions, loops, and input validation‚Äîskills that are essential for real-world data management and CRM-like applications.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Add New Contact:**  
  Add a new contact by entering the name, email, status (e.g., Lead, Customer, Cold), and phone number. The app normalizes the input (using `.title()`, `.lower()`, and `.strip()`) before storing it.

- **Display Contacts:**  
  View all contacts with their details in a formatted list.

- **Search Contacts:**  
  Search for contacts by:
  - **Name**
  - **Status**
  - **Phone Number**

- **Delete Contact:**  
  Delete a contact by:
  - **Name**
  - **Email**
  - **Phone**  
  The app asks for confirmation before deletion.

- **Show Contacts with Phone Numbers:**  
  Count and display how many contacts in the system have a phone number listed.

- **Input Validation:**  
  The app employs input validation and error handling using `try/except` to ensure data integrity.

- **Menu-Driven Interface:**  
  A simple menu allows you to choose among various options (add, view, search, delete, show phone count, exit) with clear and user-friendly prompts.
