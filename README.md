# Python Practice 🐍

Welcome to my Python learning journey!  
This repository includes small projects and exercises I'm building as I learn Python.

## Projects so far:

## Why I'm doing this:
I'm learning Python to take a step out of my comfort zone.  
This repo will track my progress and help me stay consistent.
